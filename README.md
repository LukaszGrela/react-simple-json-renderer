# React Simple JSON Renderer

Another React JSON editor/viewer, started as an attempt to reimplement with TypeScript in mind of [JSONEditor](https://github.com/constantoduol/JSONEditor.git) by [Constant Oduol](https://github.com/constantoduol) but ended up as a build from the ground up with some style similarities.
